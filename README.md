# ðŸš€ RSS-Discord 

A ðŸ¤– **Discord Bot and Rss Viewer** to view RSS feed from Discord. The basic idea is, server leaders could add the bot, then the bot would create slash commands in the server.

Users could then use the slash commands to perform actions, like subscribe to lists, read the feed, etc. Anyone in the server could view others' subscriptions, just like spotify playlists.

Every user would have their own subscription list, which they can edit anytime. The feed has been implemented using emoji-based pagination.

Supports the following commands:
- `/subscribe <URL>`: To Subscribe to a rss feed using `.xml` file URL
- `/feed`: To list the feed in time/relevance-based order.
- `/subscriptions <User>`: To list a personal/individual user's subscriptions
- `/unsubscribe`: To unsubscribe from the list
- `/ping`: To check if the Bot is working
